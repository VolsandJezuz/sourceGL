********************************************************************************
 sourceGL is now sourceGameLounge
********************************************************************************

  Along with the renaming, sourceGameLounge will now be open-source. It will
  continue to be free. It has been completely rewritten from the ground up in a
  completely different code. So it is currently not planned to have it as an
  update from sourceGL, meaning that it will not carry over sourceGL's settings.
  Other design plans for the new code are to make the releases portable and to
  utilize a plugin design to handle most of the program functionality, except
  the most basic core functions. This means that unused and unwanted functions
  can be not loaded or deleted to save drive space and reduce the memory
  footprint. And third-party plugins can be developed to make sourceGameLounge
  do practically anything you want. There will be several officially maintained
  plugins covering the most popular features that will be distributed with the
  main program.
  
  
********************************************************************************
 Versioning
********************************************************************************

  I'm attempting to use separate semantic versioning (http://semver.org/) for
  the main program and for each plugin, to make it more clear where the updates
  are occurring. I am currently very early in the initial development phase, so
  the versioning will be changing very rapidly and is somewhat arbitrary.
  Versioning has been reset and is not congruent with sourceGL versions.
  
  Current versions of the main program and the plugins that have been at least
  partially implemented:
    - sourceGameLounge 0.2.1
    - NVIDIA plugin 0.1.0
	
		
********************************************************************************
 Repository structure
********************************************************************************

  - Main program modules in root directory
  - Plugin system is a separate DLL project in commonDLL folder
  - Plugins are separate DLL projects, each in their own folder within the
    plugins folder
  - A 'template' plugin project is in the plugin folder, to serve as a blank
    guide for demonstrating the requirements for coding a third-party plugin
  - Files to generate/modify the GUI are provided, including the images folder
  - The project files will automically copy the build's runtime files into the
    program-dir folder, which includes all the other files to make the contents
    of that folder equivalent to a portable release.

 Build notes
********************************************************************************
	  
  - BOOSTDIR needs to be defined as a macro in VS 2013 in order for the project
    additional include/library directories to work as-is, for example with the
    default install folder: $(BOOSTDIR) = C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_62_0
  - QTDIR may need to be user defined as a macro, but the Qt Add-in should do
    this, with the default install folder: $(QTDIR) = C:\Qt\Qt5.7.0\5.7\msvc2013
  - Information on how to define macros in VS 2013: http://bit.ly/2fpK6P2
  - Currently, everything is half-implemented, at best. Commenting is also very
    poor right now and there is a lot of placeholder code that I've just been 
    using to test basic functionality.
